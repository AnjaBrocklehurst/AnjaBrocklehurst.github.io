**Key Events Related to Vehicle Theft Reduction:**  
The graph is showing the different recorded initiatives of San Francisco to reduce the number of vehicle thefts.
**(A)** Car manufacturers updated car keys to include microchips making it almost impossible to [bypass a car](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/upshot/heres-why-stealing-cars-went-out-of-fashion.html).

**(B)** The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) and LoJack Corporation launched a nationwide educational campaign to raise awareness about vehicle theft prevention, encouraging owners to take [protective measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Theft_Protection_Program?utm_source).

**(C)** Police Chief Bill Scott reassigned 69 officers to neighborhood foot patrols, nearly doubling the number in high-crime areas. This contributed to a significant drop in larceny thefts, including [vehicle break-ins](https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/San-Francisco-auto-break-ins-UC-study-finds-13443374.php?utm_source).

**(D)** The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) expanded its use of technology, including drones, automated license plate readers (ALPRs), bait cars, and plainclothes operations, leading to a sharp decrease in auto break-ins in [2024](https://www.sf.gov/news--san-francisco-police-using-new-technology-target-auto-break-ins-making-arrests-hotspot-areas).
 

This fact could be due to technological advancement that was implemented by car manufacturers in the 1990s which made it essentially impossible to start a car without the ignition key [Barro, Josh. 2014. Here's why Stealing Cars Went Out of Fashion. The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/upshot/heres-why-stealing-cars-went-out-of-fashion.html). The ignition key was redesigned with a microchip that is uniquely programmed by the dealer to match the car. Judging by the drop in vehicle theft criminals don't seem to have been able to counterfeit the keys â€“ or it is not profitable.
However, one would assume that only new car keys have microchips and therefore that the number of vehicle theft would gradually decrease as cars get replaced with newer models. Yet in San Francisco, the reduction of vehicle theft seems to happen in the same year. In 2006 vehicle theft decreased in San Francisco by 60%.
Now, according to this low-quality source [San Francisco Metro Area Population 1950-2025. Macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/cities/23130/san-francisco/population) the population in SF was 3,246,000 in 2003 and 3,363,000 in 2025, indicating that it is not probable that nr of cars decreased in the area during the same time.

Another observation is that vehicle theft does not decrease down to zero that might indicate that there are some cars that are either a. not locked properly or b. worth the effort for organized vehicle theft. Given that in scenario a the perpetrators are equally spread around the city (an unlocked vehicle is not more likely to be stolen by organized crime than pedestrians), one would assume that improper locking of cars are not prone to an unequal spread of vehicle thefts throughout the city of SF, but the second reason could.
