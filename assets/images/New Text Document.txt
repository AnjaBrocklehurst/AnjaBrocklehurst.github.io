Would it work to just use this as a notebook?

This document is the notebook for the website on Science-Based Targets and is a part of the final assigment for Course 02806 "Social data analysis and visualization" taught in DTU in spring 2025.
Students are Anja Brocklehurst, Gudrun Gudmundsdottir & Marc Hansen.

1. Motivation

The motivation behind the choice of subject is an interest into corporate sustainability and to investigate the work corporations do for future generations, with a special focus on Denmark.
The SBTi collects information about company's targets and making them available on their [website](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) for transparency. The data used for this analysis has been collected from the SBTi website and is available in two formats:
A. By Companies - represents the commitments made on a company basis (in March 2025: 1.6 MB, 10890 rows with 10 columns)
B. By Targets - is a collection of targets and the details thereof (in March 2025: 2.9 MB, 17169 rows with 7 columns)
We wanted to find out what the data had to offer and then show, both the positive trajectory and a few companies that had stumbeled.
Finally, we want to make it clear how Denmark is doing relative to global and european countries and whether or not the danish government is going to meet their targets.


2. Bastic stats

First we reduced the number of columns to data that could be presented visually, cleaning duplicates and unifying how things were spelled in the data.
The biggest simplification that we did for the data was to group the company sectors. This regrouping was deemd necessary to keep the communication simple.
Due to the timing of the extraction of data being in March 2025 we chose to only look at commitments that were made until end of year 2024.



3. Data analysis

To be able to do a prognosis of the Danish commitments... @Anja
We also read into sources that were supportive of the information we had from out data, finding two specially relevant sources:
A. [Committment ot the science based targets initiative (SBTi) in Denmark](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c8265907d0c91092007f8cf/t/65522a4eaed01f0ac05bd6cd/1699883605436/Rapport+SBTi.pdf)
B. [Danish Climate program on 2024](https://klimaraadet.dk/sites/default/files/node/field_files/Denmark%E2%80%99s%202035%20Climate%20Target%20.pdf)

5. Visualizations

We chose to go for a visual identidy for a clean look.
The line graphs, bar graphs and pie charts were the most clear visualisation 

6. Discussion

We are happy about the story we managed to tell.
We were struggling to find graphs that could reflect what we had learnt because they seemd redundant and overcomplicating the message.

7. Contributions

Anja Brocklehurst - Made the data cleaning, visual identidy, graphs regarding the Danish SBTi commitments
Gudrun Gudmundsdottir - Made the storyline and investigation, graphs regarding the popularity of the SBTi and key statistical data dashboard for SBTi & Denmark
Marc Hansen - Made graphs related to the comparison of Denmark, Europe and global, created to website and made the content visual on the website.
