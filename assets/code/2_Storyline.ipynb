    "# Context and climate change\n",
    "In the year 2025, practically all humans have heard about climate change. People do not always agree on its severity or urgency but there is a consensus amongst scientists that the changes are happening and that they are manmade i.e. caused by human industries and ways of living. The changes observed range from local pollution, ocean temperature, salitinty and acidification, atmospheric chemical composition to ecosystem collaps and biodiversity extinction. In fact, these changes were observed as early as the 1970s, yet in 2025 people don't have the clarity of the emissions they cause to be able to make decisions to support sustainable change.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a human that has ever worried about climate change you might have already asked yourself, what can I do? You might even have gone into action and done some research on where your emissions come from and whether you can find alternative solutions to your habits. Through this research you probably also realized that this is complicated because companies will try to make themselves look better than they are - and not always because they want to trick you but because they don't know any better themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that most companies have been facing the last years have been:\n",
    "- They didn't know if or how much they were contributing to climate change\n",
    "- They didn't know how to reduce emissions of their operations\n",
    "- They didn't know how to set realistic, science-based targets and how to talk about them\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is where Science-Based Target Initiative comes in\n",
    "Scinence-Based Target Initiative (SBTi) is an organisation that allows companies and financial instritutions to set and committ to emission regduction targets. The SBTi establishes and advocates for best practices in reducing emissions and setting net-zero targets, aligning with climate science.  The organisation creates standards, tools, and guidance to help companies and financial institutions set science-based targets informed by the latest climate research and helps aligning these targets to the goals set by the Paris agreement. Additionally, SBTi Services evaluates and verifies targets set by businesses and financial institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SBTi collects information about company's targets and making them available on their (website)[https://sciencebasedtargets.org/] for transparency. The data used for this analysis has been collected from the SBTi website and is available in two formats:\n",
    "1. By Companies - represents the commitments made on a company basis (in March 2025: 1.6 MB, 10890 rows with 10 columns)\n",
    "2. By Targets - is a collection of targets and the details theirof (in March 2025: 2.9 MB, 17169 rows with 7 columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few chapters this data is analysed in terms of growth and popularity of the SBTi, the regulations that helped boost the organisation, as well as what countries and industries are putting forward their committments. Thereafter, the focus will switch over to Denmark, what companies were the first movers, what industries are dominating - and what companies should be there but aren't and who has retracted targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBTi started helping companies committing to emissions reduction targets in 2015, starting with a Belgian company called Thalys.\n",

    "As of 2025, over 10 thousand companies world wide has either committed to or set science based emissions reduction targets validated by the SBTi. The SBTi however, wasn't popular from the start and is done on a voluntary basis, meaning that these 10 thousand companies have registered without there being a specific regulation that promotes the SBTi. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024 the commitments to SBTi grew by 81% in comparison to 2023, 867 of which set net zero targets for themselves, meaning companies have set out to (achieve atmospheric balance by balancing out their emission with removals of Greenhous Gas (GHG) emissions (also called climate offsets) over a specified period)[https://plana.earth/academy/what-is-difference-between-carbon-neutral-net-zero-climate-positive].\n",
    "\n",
    "(Expired targets refers to) an expired commitment time frame and means that a company needs to committ to new targets[https://sciencebasedtargets.org/blog/commitment-compliance-policy-what-you-need-to-know]. Retracted or withdrawn targets on the other hand refers to a target that either has been withdrawn by the company due to unsufficient follow up to their committments or, simply that the company has decided they will not follow their targets. Currently, 0,32 % of companies have retracted their targets.\n",

    "The popularity of SBTi has grown at an astounding rate, from 58 in 2019 to over 10 thousand in 2025. Initially, this growth was solely due to corporations but since 2020 small and medium enterprises (SME) gained ground and became equally engaged in number of committments. Although financial institutions are not overly represented among the companies in the data their participation is important, and according to SBTi, (the key to unlocking the system-wide change needed to reach a net-zero global economy)[https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sectors/financial-institutions]. Through financial institution's committments they will have to reduce the emissions of their portfolios, meaning that their lending, investments and other capital market activities, will be consistent with the Paris agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to be SBTi validated companies must apply, go though a validation process where their GHG accounting is audited, their targets need to be defined, reduction initiatives outlined and aligned with the Paris agreement's goals. The SBTi supports these companies in setting the right targets based on their GHG books and, if deemd reasonable, (approved) [https://sbtiservices.com/services/corporates_fi]. The process is extensive and time consuming and therefore the validation has a slight delay which gives an insight into its growth in popularity. As mentioned before, the SBTi validated its first company in 2015, and thereonafter companies have been fighting to register for their commitments to be validated and publicly available.\n",

    "* Growth of Top 20 sectors over time\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBTi is most popular in the European region, followed by Asia and the Americas (North America, Latin America and the Caribbean). The country with the most committments is Japan with 1408 commitments, which is more than other Asian countries combined. In Europe however, the UK, Germany, Sweden, France and Denmark hold the top 5 seats by number of comittments. When we look at the most comittment happy sectors, the top 5 are Professional services, Construction, Technology, Cosumer Product and Manufacturing. These secotrs are therefore likely to drive the sustainable change in Europe, influencing neighbouring regions and sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sectors that are least engaged with the SBTi are the Pharmaceutical sector, Coal mining and Gas utilities sector. Although the participation of Coal and Gas would be benefitial to the initiative, the companies in these sectors would most likely need to go through substantial shifts to be able to realistically contribute to the lowering of emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBTi is founded, funded and partnered in the right circumstances, offering support to businesses that makes business sense - increaseing brand reputation, giving investor confidence, making businesses resilient against regulations, increases innovation toward optimisation, driving bottom line savings and giving competitive edge. Given that this is correct one would assume that retracting targets would decrease brand reputation, reducing investor confidence and reduce competitive edge.\n",

    "# SBTi scrutiny - Conclusion\n",
    "There are plenty of players that have been critical toward SBTi and for good reasons. The so called \"science-based\" methods of the target setting has been commented on, as well as their reliance on the GHG protocol and lack of resources when it comes to monitoring after companies have set their goals. Additionally, there was a controversy around the organisation when they published that they would be evaluating carbon offsetts as emission reduction in 2024, that was then retracted a few months later. Although, there are many flaws with the Science-Based Target initative, but in the current maturity of the climate industry and compared to the alternative of not having a business centered target commitment strategy, the SBTi has helped companies to structure their environmental committments all around the world.\n"
